# Mac Performance Optimizer

Finds WHY a Mac is slow by measurement, not by guessing which app to quit. The
collector script does all arithmetic and flags every threshold (including a
CRITICAL must-act-now gate); this skill identifies the bound *layer* from honest
signals, drills to the one responsible process generically, and returns a
prioritized, copy-paste-ready report.

## How This Skill Stays Reliable and Generic

- **The script computes; you interpret.** `mac-optimize.sh` pre-flags memory/CPU
  pressure, the `SYSTEM STATE` gate, browser/session counts, and vendor boot
  weight in deterministic bash. MUST report its values and flags verbatim — never
  recompute GB from raw `vm_stat`.
- **No hardcoded app list.** Detection keys off *measurements and roles* (a
  compositor that is CPU-bound, a non-Apple daemon pegging a core, a window-leak
  owner, a vendor with zero running jobs) — discovered live on whatever machine
  this runs on. MUST NOT tell the user to look at a specific named third-party app
  unless the live data itself surfaced it.
- **"Used RAM" lies; pressure tells the truth.** Judge memory ONLY by kernel
  pressure level + live swap-out delta, never by "free" or "used" GB.

---

## Procedure

Execute steps [S1]–[S7] in order. Each ends with a VERIFY gate — do NOT proceed
until it passes.

### Step 1 [S1]: Snapshot, then CONFIRM with a sustained monitor

The one-shot dump uses ps %CPU, which on macOS is a lifetime DECAYING AVERAGE — it
can both miss an intermittent hog and over-blame a process that just spiked. So
diagnosis is two phases: snapshot to find suspects, then a real-time window to
CONFIRM which suspect is actually sustained.

**Phase 1a — snapshot.** MUST run:

```bash
bash "$HOME/.claude/skills/mac-optimizer/mac-optimize.sh"
```

**Phase 1b — sustained monitor (the confirmation pass).** MUST run a 30s window
when ANY row below is true:

| Condition | Run `--monitor 30`? |
|---|---|
| `SYSTEM STATE` is CRITICAL or STRAINED | MUST |
| User reports lag / stutter / "slow sometimes" / mouse movement lag / Google Chrome tab-open lag / typing lag / drag or screen-share lag | MUST (run it *while reproducing* if possible) |
| Any process or the compositor looks bound in BOTTLENECK LAYERS | MUST |
| HEALTHY and the user only wanted a quick audit | MAY skip |

```bash
bash "$HOME/.claude/skills/mac-optimizer/mac-optimize.sh" --monitor 30
```

This samples for 30s and tags each process `SUSTAINED` (real culprit) /
`intermittent` / `transient-blip` (noise), plus the load trend and whether swap
thrashed during the window. The monitor measures only process CPU persistence,
load-average trend, and swap-out activity. It does not measure input latency,
tab-open latency, the frontmost app, GPU activity, disk latency, thermal state, or
per-action timestamps. Do not claim correlation with those signals unless a separate
probe captured them. MUST treat only `SUSTAINED` (or repeated `intermittent`)
processes as confirmed system contributors — a `transient-blip` MUST NOT be
reported as the culprit even if its one-shot %CPU was high.

When an interaction symptom is reported, run the monitor while reproducing the
exact action and record that action in the report:

- **Mouse movement lag**: move the pointer continuously across windows during the
  sample; correlate only with WindowServer/process CPU, load trend, and swap activity.
  Use snapshot GPU data as a baseline, not as action-time proof.
- **Google Chrome tab-open lag**: open several new tabs in succession during the
  sample; correlate only with repeated browser-process CPU entries, load trend, and
  swap activity. Browser bloat or one-shot GPU/disk metrics alone do not prove
  tab-open latency.
- **Typing lag**: type continuously in the affected app during the sample; correlate
  only with the surfaced app/WindowServer process CPU, load trend, and swap activity.
  Do not claim focused-app or per-keystroke timing because the monitor does not record
  frontmost-app state or input events.

A repeated `intermittent` row is time-coincident evidence, not proof of causality,
because the monitor has no per-action timestamps. If no process or layer is sustained
or repeats during reproduction, state that the monitor captured no confirmed system
contributor for that symptom; do not infer a culprit from the user's symptom or from
a single one-shot spike.

**VERIFY [S1]**: Snapshot output contains `=== DERIVED METRICS` and
`=== BOTTLENECK LAYERS`. If the monitor was required, its output contains
`=== SUSTAINED MONITOR` with a process-persistence table. If the snapshot is
absent → the script failed; report the error and STOP.

---

### Step 2 [S2]: Read the SYSTEM STATE gate FIRST

MUST read the `SYSTEM STATE:` line in DERIVED METRICS before anything else.

| SYSTEM STATE | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `CRITICAL` | Box is actively degrading now | MUST open the report with a 🚨 **MUST-RUN NOW** section naming the single immediate action for the printed trigger, BEFORE any HIGH/MED/LOW advice |
| `STRAINED` | Under real load, not an emergency | Normal report; top items go in 🔴 HIGH |
| `HEALTHY` | No live degradation | Normal report; say so plainly |

Map the CRITICAL trigger → immediate action:

| CRITICAL trigger (from the line) | 🚨 MUST-RUN NOW action |
|---|---|
| `active memory thrash` | Free memory now: identify the top-RSS process/family (S4) and quit/kill it; `sudo purge` only as stopgap |
| `CPU oversubscribed` | Identify the top `%CPU` process (S4); `kill -TERM <PID>` if runaway, or `sudo renice 20 -p <PID>` |
| `disk almost full` | Free space now (empty Trash, remove large caches); the system cannot page or save until it has headroom |

**VERIFY [S2]**: SYSTEM STATE noted. If CRITICAL, a 🚨 MUST-RUN NOW action is chosen
from the table.

---

### Step 3 [S3]: Identify the bound layer

MUST read `=== BOTTLENECK LAYERS ===` and pick the bound layer(s). Multiple can be
bound at once — treat the top CPU consumers as a list and resolve each.

| Signal in BOTTLENECK LAYERS | Bound layer | Drilldown section |
|---|---|---|
| WindowServer high CPU **and** GPU idle residency high / low clock | Compositor, CPU-thread bound | window-count leak, then fill-rate |
| WindowServer high CPU **and** GPU active at high clock | Compositor, fill-rate bound | fill-rate |
| A non-Apple-**app** daemon (a system/3rd-party background process, not your foreground app) holds ~1+ core | CPU, runaway daemon | runaway daemon |
| `Memory pressure level` ≥2 **and** swap-out delta >0 | Memory (active thrash) | memory |
| pressure level 1 / swap delta 0 even if "used" looks huge | NOT memory — rule it out | re-check other rows |
| GPU active residency high at high clock, workload is render/ML/video | GPU | GPU |
| `UI Looks like` LARGER than native resolution | Compositor amplifier (supersampled scaling) | fill-rate |

**VERIFY [S3]**: At least one layer is named as bound, OR all layers are explicitly
ruled out (then the cause is process-level, go to S4).

---

### Step 4 [S4]: Drill to the responsible process (generic heuristics)

MUST read `TOP PROCESSES BY CPU`, `TOP PROCESSES BY MEMORY`, and
`HEAVY LONG-RUNNING PROCESSES`. Apply these role/measurement heuristics — none
names a third-party app; the data fills in the name:

| Generic signal | Meaning | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| WindowServer %CPU high (compositor) | see S3 — drill via `guides/drilldowns.md` compositor sections + `window_count.py` | HIGH |
| `kernel_task` high %CPU | thermal throttling defense | HIGH (check POWER & THERMAL) |
| A non-Apple-app daemon at ~1+ core (≈100%+ one core) | runaway background daemon | HIGH (drilldowns: runaway daemon) |
| Any single process `%CPU` > 100 that is not the app you're actively using | runaway / leak | HIGH |
| Any process with `CPU_TIME` accrued many hours (see the `(Xh)` value) | long-running leak candidate | MEDIUM |
| Any single process RSS > ~2 GB | memory-heavy helper | MEDIUM |
| `window_count.py` shows one owner with ≥100 windows | compositor window leak | HIGH |

**MUST cross-check every flagged process against the `=== SUSTAINED MONITOR ===`
verdict from [S1b]**: report it as the cause only if the monitor tagged it
`SUSTAINED` (or repeatedly `intermittent`). A `transient-blip` is sampling noise —
note it as ruled-out, do NOT recommend acting on it.

For any confirmed process, **MUST NOT guess from its name** — open
[guides/drilldowns.md](guides/drilldowns.md) and follow the matching section,
which uses `lsof` + `log show` to learn what the process is actually doing before
recommending a durable fix. For a suspected window leak, run:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with pyobjc-framework-Quartz python3 \
  "$HOME/.claude/skills/mac-optimizer/scripts/window_count.py"
```

**VERIFY [S4]**: Every process matching a row above is flagged with a severity, or
"no abnormal process patterns" is stated explicitly.

---

### Step 5 [S5]: Background / boot weight (vendor-generic)

MUST read `=== THIRD-PARTY LAUNCH JOBS ===` (vendor-grouped, Apple excluded) and
the pre-flagged `Browser TOTAL` / `Claude sessions` lines. These are discovered
from the machine, not a fixed list:

| Generic signal | Recommend |
|---|---|
| A vendor with jobs but `idle — 0 running` | Pure boot weight — disable that vendor's jobs if not used (do NOT assume unused; phrase as "disable if not in use") |
| A vendor carrying many jobs | Consolidate; the more login jobs, the more startup/background drain |
| `Browser TOTAL` flagged BLOAT | Close idle browser windows/tabs; run one browser family, not several |
| `Claude sessions` flagged TRIM | Close idle agent/terminal sessions |

**VERIFY [S5]**: Every `idle — 0 running` vendor and any BLOAT/TRIM flag appears in
the recommendations with a generic `launchctl bootout`+`disable` example.

---

### Step 6 [S6]: Bucket every finding by impact

| Bucket | Goes here |
|---|---|
| 🚨 MUST-RUN NOW | ONLY when SYSTEM STATE = CRITICAL — the single immediate action from S2 |
| 🔴 HIGH | The bound layer's fix; any runaway process; thermal; disk LOW-SPACE |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Window/transparency/scaling amplifiers, browser/session bloat, >2GB helpers, long-running leaks |
| 🟢 LOW | Idle vendor boot weight, duplicate updaters, optional reboot |

**VERIFY [S6]**: Every flag from S2–S5 is in exactly one bucket. 🚨 appears only if
CRITICAL.

---

### Step 7 [S7]: Emit the report using this template

MUST output the sections below in order. This is a STRUCTURE template — fill
`{placeholders}` with THIS machine's data; copy no example values. The 🚨 section
appears ONLY when SYSTEM STATE = CRITICAL.

```markdown
## Mac Health Check — {chip} / {ram}GB / macOS {version}

{🚨 **MUST-RUN NOW** — only if SYSTEM STATE = CRITICAL:
one line naming the trigger + the single immediate command. Put this ABOVE the table.}

### Summary
| Metric | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| System state | {HEALTHY / STRAINED / CRITICAL + 1-line basis} | {🟢/🟡/🚨} |
| Memory | pressure level {N}, swap delta {N} ({"bound" only if ≥2 & delta>0}) | {icon} |
| Bound layer | {compositor / CPU / GPU / memory / none} | {icon} |
| CPU | {load} on {cores} cores = {util}% | {icon} |
| Disk | {free} GB free | {icon} |
| Uptime | {d days h hours} | {icon} |
| Reproduction | {mouse movement / Google Chrome new-tab / typing / none} | {performed / not performed / inconclusive} |
| Confirmation | {"monitored Ns during {reproduction}: <culprit> SUSTAINED" or "monitored Ns during {reproduction}: no confirmed system contributor" or "interaction probe inconclusive (monitor has no action timestamps)" or "snapshot only (healthy quick audit)"} | {icon} |

{If pressure level is 1: one sentence stating memory is NOT the cause despite any large "used"/low "free", because pressure is normal and swap delta is 0.}

### Bound layer & responsible process
{What the measurement shows is bound, and the specific process the live data
named (from S3/S4), CONFIRMED by the 30s monitor (state it was SUSTAINED, not a
blip) — with the drilldown method used, not a guess. If no process or layer was
confirmed during reproduction, state that explicitly and do not name a responsible
process. If action timing was unavailable, state that the interaction probe was
inconclusive.}

### Recommendations
{🚨 MUST-RUN NOW — only if CRITICAL}
**🔴 HIGH** — {item → why → fix}
**🟡 MEDIUM** — {item → why → fix}
**🟢 LOW** — {item → why → fix}

### Quick wins (copy-paste)
```bash
{only commands relevant to THIS machine's flags; GUI apps via quit, sudo handed to user}
```

### Next step — pick one
- {tailored option A}
- {tailored option B}
```

Status icon map: `HEALTHY`/`LOW`/`OK`/level 1 → 🟢; `STRAINED`/`MODERATE`/`MEDIUM`/level 2 → 🟡; `CRITICAL`/`HIGH`/level 4/`BLOAT`/`TRIM` → 🔴 (use 🚨 for the CRITICAL system state).

**VERIFY [S7]**: Final message has Summary, Bound layer & responsible process,
Recommendations, and a ```bash Quick wins block. If SYSTEM STATE was CRITICAL, a
🚨 MUST-RUN NOW line precedes the Summary.

---

## Quick Win Command Reference

Use only commands relevant to the flags raised. GUI apps → prefer `quit` over
`kill`. `sudo` commands MUST be handed to the user to run themselves.

```bash
# Restart a stuck GUI service (safe, auto-relaunches) — e.g. the file/UI layer
killall Finder

# Free memory under active thrash (stopgap; find+stop the real hog too)
sudo purge

# Lower a runaway process instead of killing it
sudo renice 20 -p <PID>
sudo taskpolicy -b -p <PID>      # confine to efficiency cores

# Quit an app not in use
osascript -e 'quit app "AppName"'

# Disable a launch job (modern macOS — NOT the deprecated launchctl unload)
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/<vendor.job>.plist
sudo launchctl disable system/<vendor.job-label>

# Terminate a specific heavy process by PID (warn the user first)
kill -TERM <PID>
```

`launchctl unload` is deprecated and fails on modern macOS — always use
`launchctl bootout` / `launchctl disable`. These need `sudo`; tell the user to run
them in their own terminal.

## Drilldowns and the window-leak detector

- **Per-layer durable fixes** (compositor leak/fill-rate, runaway daemon, memory,
  GPU): [guides/drilldowns.md](guides/drilldowns.md) — read the section for the
  bound layer from S3.
- `scripts/window_count.py` — EXECUTE via
  `uv run --no-project --with pyobjc-framework-Quartz python3`. Per-app CGWindow
  count; one owner with 100s–1000s = a compositor window leak (S4).

## Special Case: A Process That Keeps Respawning (launchd KeepAlive)

A process you `kill` returns with a new PID and **PPID=1** → a launchd job with
`KeepAlive=true` restarts it. The same program can be registered in MULTIPLE
domains at once — a `gui/<uid>` user agent AND a root `system` daemon — so
disabling only the user agent leaves the root daemon alive.

```bash
# Find every plist across all domains that launches the program
grep -rl "ProgramName" ~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons 2>/dev/null
# For each: bootout + disable (sudo only for the system daemon)
launchctl bootout      gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<job>.plist
launchctl disable      gui/$(id -u)/<job-label>
sudo launchctl bootout system       /Library/LaunchDaemons/<job>.plist
sudo launchctl disable system/<job-label>
pgrep -fl "ProgramName"   # verify: prints nothing after a few seconds
```

Always warn the user before suggesting `kill` — prefer `osascript -e 'quit app'`
for GUI apps.
